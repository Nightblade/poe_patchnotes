The Kalandra Challenge League

    Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!
    In the Kalandra Challenge league, you will travel to the mirrored lake that granted Kalandra her powers of reflection. Her Lake itself has the power to reflect entire encounters from elsewhere in Wraeclast. As you explore the Lake, these reflections emerge from its mirrored surface.
    As you play through the league, you'll occasionally encounter a set of columns protruding from the ground, with a mirrored tablet on top. This tablet invites you to construct a custom set of encounters at the Lake of Kalandra, offering a series of different reflections to place in whatever layout you wish. Each of these reflections represents an encounter that you must defeat when you next travel to the Lake.
    As you push farther out onto the Lake's shrouded waters, you will find each encounter to be more difficult, but more rewarding. This difficulty value counts up by one for each location away from the entrance the encounter is. To manipulate this, there are occasional options that can be chosen which allow you to move and swap the entrance, reflections, and water tiles on the tablet.
    Additionally, as you progress through the league, you'll be able to unlock special abilities that let you manipulate the options you have available on each tablet. If you don't like any of the choices available to you, you can earn the ability to skip picking one entirely. The next ability is even stronger - it lets you reroll the list of options so that you can immediately pick another one. Finally, you can earn the ability to Exile a choice entirely. For the rest of this tablet, that choice will no longer appear.
    Once you reach maps, you'll be able to itemise your Mirrored Tablets, so that they don't have to be played immediately. They can be stored for later or traded with other players.
    Among the many rewards you can find at the lake is a way of acquiring a new variation of rare jewellery. Some reflecting mist offers you two rings or amulets, perfect mirror copies of each other except that on each item, a set of mods is entirely negated, having a detrimental impact on your character. All of the mods on these items are scaled up to much higher values than they would normally be. You may pick only one of these items to take from the lake.
    A rarer version of this reward can also be found that allows you to bring your own ring or amulet, distorting and reflecting it with the same crafting process. It will certainly be tempting to gamble with some of your best jewellery, to try to double the values that really matter for your build, and negate the ones you don't care about.
    With 3.19.0, there are Standard, Hardcore and Solo Self-Found variations of the Lake of Kalandra challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items. You can create private league versions of these leagues, with mods that make the game harder.
    The new challenge league includes a set of 40 new challenges, with microtransaction rewards for completing challenges. These rewards are only obtainable in this league, and will be revealed in an upcoming news post.

New Content and Features

    Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Galvanic Field: Applies a buff boosting chance to shock. When you shock an enemy while you have this buff, creates a spherical field of energy attached to the shocked enemy for a duration, which will damage it and other nearby enemies with beams of lightning. The strength of the field depends on the magnitude of shock affecting the enemy when it is created.
    Added a new Intelligence Skill Gem - Lightning Conduit: Lightning strikes all Shocked enemies around a targeted location, then removes Shock from those enemies. Shocks cannot expire on enemies in range while casting this spell. Cannot be supported by Spell cascade or Unleash.
    Added a new Intelligence Support Gem - Overcharge: Supports any skill that hits enemies, granting them a chance to shock but causing them to deal less damage. Supported skills shock enemies as though dealing more damage.
    Added a new Dexterity Skill Gem - Alchemist's Mark: Curses a single enemy, granting flask charges when you hit them and creating Burning Ground under them if your hit Ignites them, and Caustic Ground if it Poisons them. Damage modifiers do not apply to these ground effects. You can only have one Mark at a time.
    Added 14 new Unique Items, including 1 designed by a winner of the Siege of the Atlas Boss Kill Event, and 1 designed by a supporter.
    Added 15 new Divination Cards, 12 of which were designed by our supporters, with 3 designed by winners of the Siege of the Atlas Boss Kill Event.
    Added 5 new ring base types, available in The Lake of Kalandra.
    Introduced Atlas Memories as a new core game mechanic. In maps, you'll very rarely find a Memory item, which represents a set of memories that an NPC has about their past. Each successive map in the sequence gets more difficult and rewarding as the memories intensify.
    Introduced extremely rare foil versions of Pinnacle Unique Items. These are functionally equivalent to the regular versions, just shiny.
    The Trialmaster has returned! The Trialmaster boss fight can be accessed through the newly introduced Tower of Ordeals Unique Map.
    Introduced the Reflective Oil, which can be used to anoint Mirrored items.
    When buying items from a vendor or using a crafting bench, currency items are now taken from your character's inventory and any stash tabs you have opened in the current instance, followed by the first of: your stash tab with the Currency Affinity set, your Currency Stash Tab, your leftmost non-specialised stash tab.
    Continued to incrementally improve the sound, art, effects and environments.

Archnemesis

    We have been re-examining what role rare and magic monsters have in Path of Exile, regarding how often you should encounter rare and magic monsters, how difficult they should be to kill and how rewarding their deaths should be.
    Previously, league content made fights hard by spawning a lot of rare monsters. In some cases, six to eight times the normal rate of rare monsters. Now that we have better mods available to make fights against rare monsters individually challenging, we have gone through the whole game and normalised the rate that rare monsters are spawned. Some leagues had quite large reductions in spawn rate. You won't encounter situations with dozens of rare monsters on screen at once anymore. Where necessary, we have rebalanced rewards to compensate.
    In addition, Archnemesis modifiers have had their rewards reviewed. The number of mods directly correlates to increased item drop bonuses, and powerful modifiers that show up in the third and fourth mod slot use a new reward conversion system that stacks with the other drop bonuses and with player item rarity and quantity.

Details:

Spoiler

    Lowered the number of Rare and Magic Monsters encountered through various League encounters.
    Lowered the number of Rare Monsters spawned in the Summit, Gardens and Basilica Map Boss encounters.
    Lowered the number of Rare Monsters spawned in Doryani's Machinarium, and the number of Rare and Magic Monsters spawned in The Coward's Trial.
    Assembled Metamorphs no longer summon minions at various life thresholds.
    The Ritual Tribute from sacrificing Rare Monsters has been increased, to compensate for the reduced number of Rare Monsters now spawned.
    The Immune Response Atlas Notable Passive Skill now causes Blight Encounters in your Maps to spawn 50% more Non-Unique Monsters (previously 100%), and causes Blight Monsters in your Maps to spawn 100% faster (previously 150%).
    The Abyssal Army Atlas Notable Passive Skill now causes Abysses in your Maps to spawn 50% increased monsters (previously 100%).
    The Unspeakable Offensive Atlas Notable Passive Skill no longer causes Harbingers in your Maps to summon 60% more Minions.
    The Flash Breach Atlas Notable Passive Skill now causes Breaches in your Maps to have 20% increased Area of Effect (previously 30%), and 20% increased Monster density (previously 30%).
    During the campaign, Rare Monsters you encounter will only have one or two modifiers.
    In Maps, you'll stop encountering Rare Monsters with one modifier, and will mostly encounter Rare Monsters with two or three modifiers. It is also possible to encounter Rare Monsters with four modifiers again.
    Some of the more powerful Monster modifiers now use a special reward conversion system. For example, if you defeat a monster with the Corrupter mod, all of its drops become corrupted. The Solaris-touched mod converts all of its item drops to maps. The Kitava-touched mod will cause the rarity of its drops to be upgraded by one tier, so magic becomes rare, rare becomes unique, etc). If you're lucky, you can find these conversion modifiers on both the third and fourth mod of a rare monster. This causes them to stack together. So if you kill a four-mod rare monster with both the Entangler and Kitava-touched mods on it, its heavily juiced drops will also be converted to jewels with their rarity upgraded by a tier. Due to the high amount of inherent item rarity that four-mod monsters have, this may result in several unique jewels. This conversion system is fully compatible with your item rarity and quantity bonuses, as well as the drop bonuses from all other archnemesis mods.


    The Valley of Darkness Atlas Keystone Passive Skill has been removed as a result of these changes to Rare Monster modifiers. The Stream of Consciousness Keystone has taken up Valley Of Darkness's position on the Atlas Tree.


    Magic monsters have a restricted list of archnemesis modifiers compared to rare monsters, but this list still includes many modifiers which can spawn threats external to the monsters themselves, such as ground effects or volatile orbs. These external threats can feel overwhelming due to magic monsters being more numerous than rare monsters.
    We have toned down the modifiers that can spawn on magic monsters so that more of them are stat-based bonuses that aren't too spammy. All monsters in an instance that are the same or very similar will have the same magic monster modifier, rather than rolling a different Archnemesis modifier for each monster.

Details:

Spoiler

    The following Monster modifiers can no longer appear on Magic Monsters that aren't in packs: Consecrator, Flame Strider, Frost Strider, and Storm Strider.
    The Corpse Detonator, Ice Prison, and Mirror Image Monster modifiers can no longer appear on Magic Monsters.
    Magic Monsters with the Storm Strider modifier no longer trigger a Lightning Mirage when Hit.
    Magic Monsters with the Flame Strider modifier no longer trigger an Inferno Bolt when Hit.
    Magic Monsters with the Frost Strider modifier no longer trigger a Snow Bolt when Hit.
    Magic Monsters with the Sentinel modifier no longer trigger a Delayed Reckoning when Hit.
    Magic Monsters with the Assassin modifier no longer teleport to distant Enemies creating a Smoke Cloud.

The following Archnemesis modifiers have been renamed to make their function slightly more clear from their name:

    Evocationist has been renamed to Prismatic.
    Dynamo has been renamed to Electrocuting.

    Problem: Monsters with block chance generally take a small percentage of incoming damage when they block rather than no damage at all, to prevent blocking feeling too punishing for players. However, Archnemesis modifiers that grant block chance prevent 100% of blocked damage.
    Solution: Monsters with the Sentinel and Benevolent Guardian Archnemesis modifiers now take 20% of damage from hits they block.

Beyond

    Beyond had several issues. Firstly, its art was eight years old and outdated. Secondly, the number of magic and rare monsters spawned was so much higher than the rest of the game that it provided a gigantic amount of experience and items to players who stacked it heavily, and was mostly irrelevant to everyone else. The number of rares spawned also caused problems with Archnemesis modifiers.
    The Scourge have taken over the realm of the Beyond demons. Summoning monsters from Beyond will now summon Scourge monsters and bosses. We have completely rebalanced the rate that Beyond monsters and bosses spawn at, so that it's appropriate for modern Path of Exile. The new Beyond monsters can now occasionally drop the Scourge league's Tainted currency items that allow you to modify corrupted items.

Details:

Spoiler

    Beyond portals now spawn Scourge demons instead of the old Beyond bandits. Demons are still divided into three factions, and only one faction will spawn in any single instance.
    The base chance for a Beyond portal to spawn when you kill a monster is now fixed at 15%. This means that multiple sources of the Beyond mechanic no longer stack.
    Spawning a Beyond boss no longer requires killing many Beyond demons close together. Instead, once a substantial number of Beyond demons have spawned in the instance, each pack spawned grants a stacking chance for the next pack in that area to be replaced by a boss. Only one Beyond boss can spawn per instance. Once a boss has spawned, Beyond portals will no longer spawn in that instance.
    Beyond demons will occasionally drop Tainted Currency items, and Beyond bosses are guaranteed to drop multiple Tainted Currency. Adjustments have been made to the outcome odds for the Tainted Orb of Fusing, Tainted Jeweller's Orb and Tainted Mythic Orb in order for these items to be suitable for core availability.
    All Tainted Currency items now have dedicated slots in the Exotic section of the Currency Stash Tab.
    Sextant modifiers that grant Beyond portal chance now grant increased Beyond monster pack size instead of a chance for an additional Beyond monster to spawn.
    New Beyond monsters do not drop Scourged items.

The following changes have been made to the Atlas Passive Tree as a result:

    The Fiendish Opulence Notable now causes Rare Beyond Demons in your Maps to drop an additional Basic Currency Item (previously a 25% chance). The three small nodes prior that granted 8% increased Quantity of Items dropped by Beyond Demons in your Maps now instead provide 5% increased Quantity of Tainted Currency dropped by Beyond Demons in your Maps.
    The Scent of Blood Notable no longer grants "Slaying Enemies close together in your Maps has a 3% chance to attract monsters from Beyond". Instead, it now grants 10% chance for your Maps to attract Beyond Demons.
    The Torn Veil Notable no longer grants "Powerful Beyond Demons require 1 fewer Portal to summon in your Maps". Instead, it now grants "Beyond Portals in your Maps have 30% increased chance to spawn a Unique Boss". The small nodes in the cluster that previously granted "Beyond Portals in your Maps have 5% chance to spawn an additional Beyond Demon" now instead grant "Slaying Enemies in your Maps has a 15% increased chance to spawn a Beyond Portal".

Harvest

    Rather than being presented with a selection of crafting options that must be used immediately, you now receive itemised, tradeable lifeforce of the appropriate colour. This lifeforce can be used later, in your own time, at the horticrafting bench in your hideout. Its crafting options are now priced in terms of this itemised lifeforce currency.
    Tier 4 bosses are now encountered much more frequently and can drop a key to fight Oshabi. She yields special lifeforce that can be used for a specific set of crafts.
    We have rebalanced all Harvest crafts for the new system and have removed a bunch of filler crafts and some ones with deterministic outcomes that were incredibly RNG-gated before. Some crafts that provided access to exclusive content, like the special Offerings to the Goddess, have been removed because these items can now be found in more appropriate locations elsewhere in the game.
    The result of these changes is that when you complete a harvest, you aren't presented with 30 crafts which must be either used immediately or unsafely traded to some player you've found on a community discord server. It also means that every bit of lifeforce you receive is going towards a craft that you actually want to use on one of your items, when you're ready to use it. Your interaction with the sacred grove is now far simpler as well. Just enter, pick your plots, defeat the monsters and get on with your mapping.
    Like with Archnemesis and Beyond, we have also addressed the monster composition of Harvest's fights, so that it doesn't contain too many rare monster mods and so that it is of appropriate difficulty for its rewards. In addition, the rewards for Harvest now scale with map quantity and pack size, incentivising you to juice your maps. Previously the crafts you received were not scaled up at all if you played a harder map.

Details:

Spoiler

    Harvest monsters are no longer associated with specific crafting options and do not grant uses of crafting options on death. Instead, monsters defeated now drop a stack of lifeforce.
    Lifeforce are tradable currency items which come in three types, Primal, Wild and Vivid, matching the three types of Harvest monster. Slots for these items have been added to the Currency Stash Tab.
    Lifeforce can be used at the Horticrafting Station, which has been reworked, in your hideout. Instead of functioning as a way to store crafts for later use, the Horticrafting Station is now similar to the Crafting Bench, providing a list of every Harvest crafting option to choose from.
    Each craft costs a certain amount of lifeforce to use. They can be used as many times as you like, as long as you have the necessary lifeforce.
    Harvest Bosses, including Oshabi, Avatar of the Grove, are now encountered more frequently.
    Oshabi, Avatar of the Grove, no longer drops Infused Beachheads, Dedication, Gift and Tribute to the Goddess, Lures, Infused Engineer's Orbs, or Facetor's Lenses. She now has a chance to drop Crystallised Lifeforce, which can be used for a specific set of crafting options.
    The Harvest crafting options have been overhauled. Many have been rebalanced and tweaked, while others have been removed or found new homes.
    Harvest crafting options currently stored in Horticrafting Stations will be deleted upon the release of 3.19.0. Use them before you lose them!
    Dedication, Gift and Tribute to the Goddess now have a chance to drop from reward chests at the end of the Eternal Labyrinth.
    Infused Beachhead Unique Maps now have a chance to drop from the Tier 15 The Beachhead Unique Map Boss encounter.
    Lures and Infused Engineer's Orbs can no longer be obtained.
    The Bumper Crop Notable Atlas Passive no longer grants "The Sacred Grove in your Maps contains an additional Harvest". Instead, it now grants "The Sacred Grove in your Maps has 50% chance to contain an additional Harvest".
    The Heart of the Grove Notable Atlas Passive no longer grants "Harvest Bosses in your Maps always drop a Sacred Blossom". Instead, it now grants "Harvest Crops in your maps have 60% increased chance to contain a Tier 4 Plant".
    The Bountiful Harvest Notable Atlass Passive now grants Harvested Plants in your Maps have 10% chance to spawn an additional Monster (previously 50%).
    The small Harvest Atlas Passives that granted "Plants Harvested in your Maps have 3% chance to give an additional Crafting option" now provide "Harvest Monsters in your Maps drop 3% increased quantity of Lifeforce".
    The Harvest Sextant modifiers that granted "Plants Harvested in your Maps are more likely to give less common Crafting Options" has been replaced with a modifier that causes Lifeforce dropped by Harvest Monsters in your Maps to be duplicated.
    Leo's Betrayal Research Safehouse crafting bench rewards have been replaced. They no longer Randomise the numeric values of the Implicit Modifiers of an item, randomise the numeric values of the Random Modifiers of an item, or Augment a Rare item with a new Random Modifier. Instead, they now Reforge the colours of, number of, or links between sockets on an item 50 times, using the outcome with the greatest number of less-common socket colours, sockets, or linked sockets respectively.

Return to top
Exalted and Divine Orbs

    Divine Orbs and Exalted Orbs actually have the same drop rate, but Exalted Orbs are worth so much more in trade value because there's no easy vendor recipe for them and because they're consumed when you craft certain meta-mods onto items.
    Out of these two currency items, we would actually prefer the Divine Orb effect to be rarer, so that unique items with good rolls matter more, and so that players can exalt-craft their items more frequently.
    We are making two changes that will impact this. Firstly, we are changing the cost of crafting metamods so that they cost Divine Orbs rather than Exalted Orbs. Secondly, we are changing the 6-link vendor recipe to grant 20 Orbs of Fusing rather than a Divine Orb.

Details:

Spoiler

    The "Prefixes cannot be Changed", "Suffixes cannot be Changed", and "Can have up to 3 Crafted Modifiers" crafts now have a cost of 2 Divine Orbs (previously 2 Exalted Orbs).
    The "Cannot roll Attack Mods" craft now has a cost of 1 Divine Orb (previously 1 Exalted Orb).
    The "Cannot roll Caster Mods" craft now has a cost of 1 Divine Orb (previously 5 Blessed Orbs).
    Veiled Modifiers that had a Divine Orb cost when crafted now have an Exalted Orb or Chaos Orb cost instead.
    Divine Orbs sold by Tujen, the Haggler or found as a Ritual Reward now have the same cost as Exalted Orbs.
    The Heist Trinket modifiers that provide a chance for Regal Orbs to drop as Divine Orbs instead in Heists now provide up to 4% at the highest tier (previously 5%), to match Trinket modifiers that provide a chance for Regal Orbs to drop as Exalted Orbs.
    These Heist Trinket modifiers and the Trinket modifier that provides a chance for Chaos Orbs to drop as Divine Orbs have had their levels adjusted to match similar modifiers that provide a chance for Regal Orbs or Chaos Orbs to drop as Exalted Orbs.
    The drop rate of Forbidden Shako, Judging Voices, Ventor's Gamble and The Risk has also been increased as a result of these changes.
    The Bestiary recipe that rerolls the numeric values of all modifiers of a Rare item has been changed. It now transforms a Gilded Scarab to a Winged Scarab of the same type.
    Selling an item with 6 Linked Sockets to a vendor now yields 20 Orbs of Fusing, instead of a Divine Orb.

Rebalance of Unique Items

    Problem: Many of Path of Exile's unique items are quite underwhelming when you find them. Over the years this has led to the amount of unique items dropped being raised so that finding an exciting unique item is still an occasional possibility, but this also further devalues the average case of finding a unique item on the ground.
    Solution: Reduce the number of unique items dropped throughout the game. Rebalance a large number of unique items to make them much more distinctive and exciting, at least for the level at which you can first obtain them. This set of changes focuses on unique items available during the campaign, but we will consider changes to higher level unique items for future expansions.

Details:

Spoiler

The Cheap Construction, Replica Cheap Construction, Chitus' Needle, Glitterdisc, Izaro's Dilemma, Izaro's Turmoil, Rotting Legion, Spine of the First Claimant, The Peregrine and Viper's Scales and Worldcarver Unique items can no longer drop. May they rest in peace in Standard.

Unless specifically stated otherwise, a Divine Orb should be able to be used on existing versions of these unique to obtain the new values of modifiers, but cannot be used to gain new modifiers.

    The Alberon's Warpath Unique Boots no longer has +1 to maximum number of Skeletons. Instead, it now causes your Skeleton Warriors to be Permanent Minions and Follow you. It also now has +13-19% to Chaos Resistance (previously +9-12%), and 25% increased Movement Speed (previously 20%).
    The Allelopathy Unique Gloves no longer has 20-30% increased Damage over Time, and is now a Satin Gloves.
    The Ambu's Charge Unique Body Armour no longer has Gain an Endurance Charge when you take a Critical Strike, Share Endurance Charges with nearby party members, or Regenerate 2% of Life per second if you have been Hit Recently. Instead, it now has Gain up to Maximum Endurance Charge when you take a Critical Strike, and Your nearby party members' maximum Endurance Charges are equal to yours.
    The Anvil Unique Amulet now has 10-15% Chance to Block Attack Damage (previously 8%). A Divine Orb can be used to update existing versions of this unique to the new values.
    The Apep's Rage Unique Wand now has Poisons you inflict deal Damage 30-50% faster (previously 20%). Existing versions of this unique can be updated with a Divine Orb.
    The Araku Tiki Unique Amulet no longer has Regenerate 1% of Life per second while on Low Life. Instead, it now has Gain Elusive on reaching Low Life, and Phasing while on Low Life. It also now has +150-250 to Evasion Rating while on Low Life (previously +100).
    The Asenath's Mark Unique Helmet no longer provides 10-15% increased Cast Speed, 10-15% increased Stun and Block Recovery, or 5% increased Movement Speed. Instead, it now has "Trigger a Socketed Spell when you Attack with a Bow, with a 0.3 second Cooldown" and "30-60% increased Spell Damage". These changes do not affect existing items.
    The Ashcaller Unique Wand no longer has 16-22% chance to Ignite, 20-30% increased Burning Damage, or +15-25% to Fire Damage over Time Multiplier. It now provides a 10% chance to Cover Enemies in Ash on Hit, and adds 20-24 to 38-46 to Fire Damage. It also now has a 25% chance to Trigger Level 10 Summon Raging Spirit on Kill (previously 10% chance to Trigger Level 8), and adds 20-24 to 36-46 Fire Damage to Spells (previously 4-6 to 7-9).
    The Ashrend Unique Body Armour no longer causes socketed Gems to be Supported by Level 10 Added Fire Damage, or provides +30-50 to maximum Life. It now has 75-150% increased Physical Damage with Ranged Weapons (previously 10-15%), and -30 to -60 Physical Damage taken from Attack Hits (previously -5 to -7).
    The Beast Fur Shawl Unique Body Armour no longer has +15-25 to maximum Energy Shield. It now has 120-160% increased Energy Shield (previously 110-130%), 10% increased Damage taken (previously 5%), and 50-100% increased Energy Shield Recovery rate (previously 30-40%).
    The Bitterdream Unique Sceptre now causes Socketed Gems to be Supported by Level 15 Bonechill, Hypothermia, Ice Bite, Cold Penetration, Added Cold Damage, and Inspiration (previously either Level 1 or 10). This change affects existing items, though you will need to use a Divine Orb to fix the description on the item.
    The Replica Bitterdream Unique Sceptre now causes Socketed Gems to be Supported by Level 15 Immolate, Unbound Ailments, Ice Bite, Inspiration, and Innervate (previously either Level 1 or 10). This change affects existing items, though you will need to use a Divine Orb to fix the description on the item.
    The Blackheart Unique Ring no longer provides 5% increased Global Physical Damage, or +20-30 to maximum Life. It now adds 10-15 to 20-25 Chaos Damage to Attacks (previously 1 to 3), and causes you to regenerate 10-15 Life per second (previously 2-4).
    The Blood of Corruption Unique Amulet now has a level requirement of level 5 (previously level 20).
    The Bramblejack Unique Body Armour no longer has Adds 2 to 4 Physical Damage to Attacks. It now has -10 to -15 Physical Damage taken from Attack Hits (previously -2), +30-60 to maximum Life (previously +12-20), and 1000% of Melee Physical Damage taken reflected to Attacker (previously 40%). Existing versions of this unique can be made more reflective with a Divine Orb.
    The Brine Crown Unique Helmet no longer has 60% increased Mana Regeneration Rate while stationary, +30-50% to Cold Resistance, or 5% reduced Cold Damage taken. It now has +3% to maximum Cold Resistance.

It also now has +200-300 to maximum Life (previously +200-220). The changes to the Level of Supported Gems applies to existing items, though you will need to use a Divine Orb to fix the descriptions or receive the new maximum Life values.
    The Briskwrap Unique Body Armour no longer has 5% increased Movement Speed, or 10% increased Attack Speed. Instead, it now has 1% increased Damage per 15 Dexterity. It also now has 60-100% increased Mana Recovery from Flasks (previously 20-25%), and is now a Sun Leather Body Armour.
    The Bronn's Lithe Unique Body Armour no longer has 15% increased Attack and Cast Speed if you've used a Movement Skill Recently. It now has +5 to Level of Socketed Movement Gems (previously +2), and 60-100% increased Damage with Movement Skills (previously 35-50%).
    The Chalice of Horrors Unique Shield no longer has +5% Chance to Block, +40-50 to maximum Life, or 1% of Damage Leeched as Life against Cursed Enemies.

    The Clayshaper Unique Mace no longer has Minions deal 5-8 to 12-16 additional Attack Physical Damage, or Minions have 20-30% increased maximum Life. Instead, it now has Golems deal 96-120 to 132-160 Added Attack Physical Damage.

It also now has 10-25% increased Cast Speed (previously 10-15%), 10-25% increased Attack Speed (previously 10-15%), and 10-20% reduced Skill Effect Duration (previously 10-15%).
    The Wheel of the Stormsail Unique Shield no longer grants "+5% Chance to Block" or "Curse Skills have 100% increased Skill Effect Duration". Instead, it now grants +20-40 to Evasion Rating and +50-75% to Lightning Resistance. It also now provides +20-40 to Armour (previously +5-10).
    The Windscream Unique Boots no longer have 10-20% increased Elemental Damage. Instead, it now has 50% increased Area of Effect of Hex Skills. It also now has 20% increased Movement Speed (previously 15%).
    The Wondertrap Unique Boots Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers now have values of +5-30 (previously +5-10). It also now provides +5-30 to maximum Energy Shield (previously +10-16), and 10-25% increased Movement Speed (previously 10%). Existing versions of this item can be updated to the new values with a Divine Orb.
    The Wraithlord Unique Helmet no longer has Minions Regenerate 1% of Life per second, or +1000 to Spectre maximum Life. Instead, it now has "Cannot have non-Spectre Minions", and +2 to maximum number of Spectres.
    The Wurm's Molt Unique Belt now has a level requirement of level 41 (previously level 8). The Physical Attack Damage Leeched as Life and Mana modifiers now have values of 2% (both previously 0.4%). It now has "500-1000% increased total Recovery per second from Life Leech" and "500-1000% increased total Recovery per second from Mana Leech". It also now provides +20-30% to Cold Resistance (previously +10-20%).

Fated Uniques

    Problem: When Prophecy was removed from the game in 3.17, some fated unique items were discontinued or merged with their normal version, and the remainder were moved to occasionally drop from map bosses. However, this drop method was always intended to be a temporary measure.
    Solution: The original plan was to develop a new method of making fated unique items to properly replace Prophecy. However, with a second round of fated uniques merged with their base versions by the changes listed above, it became clear that there were not enough remaining fated unique items to support such a system. We are instead just disabling fated unique items from dropping.

Details:

Spoiler

    Fated Uniques can no longer be acquired. The special modifiers on some Fated Uniques have been moved to the base version of that Unique. More information can be found in the Rebalance of Unique Items section.
    The A Note in the Wind, Akil's Prophecy, The Mad King, The Transformation, and Vile Power Divination Cards have been temporarily disabled, and existing cards cannot be turned in currently.
    Added a vendor recipe for Cameria's Avarice. Happy hunting!

As a result of this, the Fated Uniques Atlas Passive Cluster, and the Rare cluster opposite it, have been removed and replaced with skills that make it more likely to find specific Master Missions:

    The Fated Conflict Atlas Notable Passive Skill and the three small Map Boss Rarity Atlas Passive Skills leading to it have been removed from the Atlas Passive Tree.
    The Spoils of War Atlas Notable Passive Skill and the three small Rare Monster Duplication Atlas Passive Skills leading to it have been removed from the Atlas Passive Tree.
    Added a new Atlas Notable Passive Skill, Mining Partnership, which causes randomly encountered Masters in your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Niko, and Master Missions from completing your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Niko.
    Added a new Atlas Notable Passive Skill, Covert Stakeouts, which causes randomly encountered Masters in your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Jun, and Master Missions from completing your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Jun.
    Added a new Atlas Notable Passive Skill, Hunting Season, which causes randomly encountered Masters in your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Einhar, and Master Missions from completing your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Einhar.
    Added a new Atlas Notable Passive Skill, Archaeology Tour, which causes randomly encountered Masters in your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Alva, and Master Missions from completing your Maps to have a 100% increased chance to be Alva.

Defence Balance

The substantial changes to character defences contained in the 3.16 expansion had the desired effect of encouraging players to invest more heavily in character defences besides life stacking. We're happy with this direction, but will be making further changes aimed at making some of the most powerful defensive layers require more investment and improving diversity in defensive options. We are making a set of changes with this goal in 3.19, but are also considering further changes for future expansions and will be refining these plans based on discussion and your feedback.

    Problem: Spell Suppression is intended to be mostly accessible to characters on the right side of the passive skill tree. However, spell suppression values on item modifiers are high enough that any character can reasonably reach 100% spell suppression chance through items alone, and passive skills that grant suppression are relatively weak in comparison. This results in capped spell suppression feeling like a mandatory pickup for most characters that want strong defences, rather than mostly an option to complement evasion-focused builds.
    Solution: Reduce the values of spell suppression granted by item modifiers. Increase the amount of spell suppression granted by passive skills and a few other sources.

Details:

Spoiler

    Chance to Suppress Spell Damage modifiers on Dexterity Body Armours and Shields can now roll with values of +8–10% at the lowest tier (previously +17–20%), up to +20–22% at the highest tier (previously +32–34%). Crafted versions of these modifiers now have values of +5–7% (previously +8–10%) and +8–10% (previously +11–13%).
    Chance to Suppress Spell Damage modifiers on Dexterity Helmets, Boots and Gloves can now roll with values of +5–6% at the lowest tier (previously +8–10%), up to +13–14% at the highest tier (previously +20–22%). Crafted versions of these modifiers now have values of +3–4% (previously 5–6%) and +5–6% (previously 7–8%).
    The Eater of Worlds Implicit modifier on Gloves that grants a chance to Suppress Spell Damage can now roll with values of +5–10% (previously +7–12%).
    The Eater of Worlds Implicit modifier on Gloves that grants a chance to Suppress Spell Damage while a Unique Enemy is in your Presence can now roll with values of +7–12% (previously +10–15%).
    The Eater of Worlds Implicit modifier on Gloves that grants a chance to Suppress Spell Damage while a Pinnacle Atlas Boss in your Presence can now roll with values of +10–15% (previously +13–18%).
    The Corrupted Implicit Boots modifier that grants a +6–9% chance to Suppress Spell Damage now has a level requirement of 45 (previously 1).
    The Corrupted Implicit Boots modifier that grants a chance to Suppress Spell Damage while moving can no longer roll.

    The small Passive Skills in the Evasion and Spell Suppression wheel at the centre of the Passive Skill Tree now grant +4% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously 3%).
    The Inveterate Notable Passive Skill now grants +15% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +12%). The small Passive Skills in this cluster now grant +8% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +6%).
    The Entrench Notable Passive Skill now grants +12% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +10%). The small Passive Skills in this cluster now grant +5% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +4%).
    The Instinct Notable Passive Skill now grants +12% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +10%). The small Passive Skills in this cluster now grant +5% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +4%).
    The Quickstep Notable Passive Skill now grants +10% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +6%).
    The Intuition Notable Passive Skill now grants +8% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +5%).
    The Resourcefulness Notable Passive Skill now grants +8% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +5%).
    The Courage Notable Passive Skill now grants +15% chance to Suppress Spell Damage if you've Hit an Enemy Recently (previously +10%).

    The Dagger Mastery that provides a chance to Suppress Spell Damage for each Dagger you're Wielding now has a value of +10% (previously +8%).
    The Spell Suppression Mastery that provides a chance to Suppress Spell Damage if your Boots, Helmet and Gloves have Evasion now has a value of +12% (previously +10%).
    The Spell Suppression Mastery that prevents a percentage of Suppressed Spell Damage now has a value of +3% (previously +2%).

    The Aerialist Cluster Jewel Notable Passive now grants +10% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +6%).
    The Darting Movements Cluster Jewel Notable Passive now grants +12% chance to Suppress Spell Damage while moving (previously +8%).
    The Elegant Form Cluster Jewel Notable Passive now grants +10% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +6%).
    The Hit and Run Cluster Jewel Notable Passive now grants +10% chance to Suppress Spell Damage if you've Hit an Enemy Recently (previously +6%).
    The Untouchable Cluster Jewel Notable Passive now grants +10% chance to Suppress Spell Damage (previously +6%).


    Problem: Arctic Armour does not grant enough defensive power to compete with other defensive reservation skills, particularly since the majority of its protection is only granted when the player is standing still.
    Solution: Substantially increase the amount of damage reduction while stationary provided by Arctic Armour. We will likely continue to explore more efficient defensive options for characters that spend a lot of time standing still in future content updates.

Details:

Spoiler

    Arctic Armour now grants 11–21% less Physical Damage taken from Hits while stationary at gem levels 1–20 (previously 8–13%), and 11–20% less Fire Damage taken from Hits while stationary at gem levels 1–20 (previously 8–12%).
    Labyrinth Helmet Enchantments that grant increased Arctic Armour Buff Effect can no longer be obtained.


    Problem: Flesh and Stone is not powerful enough to warrant 25% mana reservation. Slight improvements to Blind investment outlined below will naturally help it to some extent, but just a little more power is needed to make it a competitive option.
    Solution: Increase the damage reduction from distant enemies that Flesh and Stone provides when in Sand Stance.

Details:

Spoiler

    Flesh and Stone now causes you to take 11–15% less Damage from Attacks from Enemies that aren't nearby while in Sand Stance at gem levels 1–20 (previously 9–11%)


    Problem: Defiance Banner provides a substantial percentage increase to armour and evasion, on top of other benefits for a low investment. It therefore grants all characters a way to further scale the large amounts of armour and evasion granted by the Determination and Grace skills. It also disproportionately benefits characters that do not have easy access to armour and evasion scaling on the passive skill tree, and when combined with Determination and Grace allows these characters to use aura effect to scale armour and evasion almost as effectively as characters directly investing into armour and evasion bonuses. This has led to the combination of Defiance Banner, Determination and Grace feeling near mandatory for characters in hardcore leagues, and very attractive elsewhere.
    Solution: Substantially reduce the armour and evasion granted by Defiance Banner.

Details:

Spoiler

    Defiance Banner now grants you and nearby allies 15–24% increased Armour and Evasion Rating at gem levels 1–20 (previously 30–49%)
    Defiance Banner now grants nearby enemies 30–40% reduced Critical Strike Chance at gem levels 1–20 (previously 20–29%)
    Anomalous Defiance Banner quality grants you and nearby allies 0.25% increased Armour and Evasion Rating per quality (previously 0.5%)


    Problem: The Wind Dancer keystone's drawback of taking 20% more attack damage if you've been hit by an attack recently is too risky to make the keystone feel like a worthwhile trade, even for characters with substantial investment in evasion, as it is too likely that you will be hit again during that time.
    Solution: Change Wind Dancer to be less risky for characters with large amounts of evasion by allowing a high evasion rating to more effectively mitigate its drawback.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Wind Dancer Keystone Passive Skill no longer provides 40% more Evasion Rating if you have been Hit by an Attack Recently. Instead, it now provides 10% more chance to Evade Attacks if you have been Hit by an Attack Recently.


    Problem: The Arrow Dancing keystone's penalty to melee evasion chance feels too punishing, even for characters with substantial investment in evasion.
    Solution: Change Arrow Dancing to provide a less extreme penalty to melee evasion but a less extreme bonus to projectile evasion.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Arrow Dancing Keystone Passive Skill no longer provides 40% more chance to Evade Projectile Attacks, or 20% less chance to Evade Melee Attacks. Instead, it now provides "Evasion Rating is Doubled against Projectile Attacks", and "25% less Evasion Rating against Melee Attacks".


    Problem: Ward is a relatively niche defensive mechanic, but currently is mainly strong when paired with the Olroth's Resolve unique flask, and not worth investing in otherwise.
    Solution: Reduce the base ward restoration time, which is already bypassed by Olroth's Resolve but a limiting factor for ward's usefulness in other cases. Allow builds to invest further in faster ward restoration if they so desire.

Details:

Spoiler

    Ward is now instantly restored after 4 seconds (previously 5 seconds).
    Added 5 tiers of a new Suffix modifier that can roll on Ward base types, granting up to 58% faster Restoration of Ward.
    The Faithguard Unique Helmet now has 40–60% faster Restoration of Ward (previously 20–30%). Existing versions of this item can be updated to the new values with a Divine Orb.


    Problem: The Grasping Mail modifier that provides 100% increased global defences provides too much value to a build heavily investing in defences for a single mod slot.
    Solution: The prefix modifier that can roll on Grasping Mails which provides increased Global Defences now has a value of 50% (previously 100%). Existing items can be made worse with a Divine Orb.

    Problem: The Gravicius Veiled Modifier on body armour that grants a percentage of your maximum life as energy shield adds a huge amount of survivability to many builds for the low investment of a single bench-crafted modifier. Granting energy shield to life-based builds was often not valuable in the past as those builds would not have a sensible way to recover energy shield in combat, but the recent addition of Ghost Dance and Divine Shield, among other changes, have made obtaining a relatively small amount of energy shield on a life-based build very valuable. The Gravicius modifier trivialises this.
    Solution: Rework the Gravicius' Veiled Modifier to instead grant a percentage of Physical Damage taken as Fire and Lightning Damage.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Gravicius' Veiled modifier on Body Armours that grants 12–14% of your maximum Life as Energy Shield has been replaced by a modifier that grants a 8–9% of Physical Damage from Hits taken as Fire Damage, and 8–9% of Physical Damage from Hits taken as Lightning Damage. Crafting bench versions of the modifier provide values of 3–4% and 5–6%. Existing items are unaffected by these changes.


    Problem: Passive skills that grant blind effect do not adequately reward investment in them.
    Solution: Increase the values of blind effect found on the passive tree.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Silent Steps Notable Passive Skill now grants 40% increased Blind Effect (previously 30%). The small Passive Skills in this cluster that provide Evasion Rating and Blind Effect now grant 15% Blind Effect (previously 10%).
    The Blind Mastery that grants increased Blind Effect now has a value of 40% (previously 30%).


    Problem: Mind over Matter, and builds that heavily invest in mana in general, have been left in an underpowered state by various balance changes and the increased power of investing in reservation skills.
    Solution: As a first step, improve the base power of Mind over Matter and pull that power out of body armour mods. We're aware that this change does not solve all problems currently facing mana builds, and are considering exactly what further changes to make for future expansions.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Mind over Matter Keystone Passive Skill now causes 40% of Damage to be taken from Mana before Life (previously 30%).
    Damage taken from Mana before Life can no longer roll as an Influence modifier, Synthesised Implicit modifier, or Eldritch Implicit modifier on Body Armour.
    The Cloak of Defiance Unique Body Armour no longer has 10% of Damage is Taken from Mana before Life.
    The Veiled modifier that grants Damage taken from Mana before Life while Focused now provides values of 18–22% (previously 28–32%). The crafted versions of this modifier now provide values of 11–15% (previously 21–25%).


    Problem: Fortification is too difficult to gain for some melee builds, and too frustrating to use for many others.
    Solution: Make fortification easier to gain and longer lasting.

Details:

Spoiler

    Melee hits that can Fortify now generate roughly twice as many Fortification stacks as previously, based on damage dealt. Fortification generation against magic and rare monsters has been further increased.
    The base duration of Fortification has been increased to 6 seconds (previously 5).
    The entry small Passive Skill in the Steadfast cluster that provides increased Fortification for Fortifying Hits now has a value of 30% (previously 20%).
    The top of the Steadfast cluster now consists of two small Passive Skills that each provide 40% increased Fortification Duration (previously one small Passive Skill that provided 20% increased Fortification for Fortifying Hits).

Minion Balance

Path of Exile is a game about finding items to improve your character. Minion builds historically got most of their power from their gems, and didn't have as many strong options to benefit from finding better items. The overall goal of these changes is to improve the variety of viable minion builds, but also make minion builds more reliant on items.

    Problem: There are limited options to invest in minion-related stats on player gear, meaning that their base stats have to be inflated to compensate. This leads to most minion builds caring too little about itemisation, and also limits the potential to scale high-end minion builds with better items.
    Solution: Lower minion base life and damage, but provide more ways for players to invest into minions on their own gear, allowing minion damage and survivability to each be higher than previously possible for a character with strong items.

Details:

Spoiler

    The damage and life scaling values for minions have been adjusted. This affects all minions other than Raise Spectre, though the damage of Animate Guardian, Animate Weapon, Blink Arrow and Mirror Arrow minions is also unaffected as they gain base damage from items instead. Generally speaking, minion life and damage is unchanged in the very early game, roughly 30% lower in mid acts, roughly 20% lower at level 20 of the minion skill, and roughly 10% lower at level 30 of the minion skill. The base life and damage of minions that are not associated with skill gems have been adjusted to counteract these changes, except for Raised Spiders from Arakaali's Fang.
    The level of monster created by the Raise Spectre Skill has been lowered, though remains unchanged at gem level 1. It now creates a level 70 monster at gem level 20 (previously 72), and level 76 monster at gem level 25 (previously 77).
    Added a new Ring base item type: Bone Ring. This Ring has an Implicit Minion Elemental Resistances modifier, and can roll Minion-related modifiers.
    Bone, Ivory and Fossilised Spirit Shields are now found with a Minions deal increased Damage Implicit modifier (previously increased Spell Damage), and can roll Minion-related modifiers.
    As a result of these Implicit modifier changes, the Manastorm Unique Shield is now a Lacewood Spirit Shield, and the Kongming's Stratagem Shield is now an Ancient Spirit Shield.
    Added two new Wand base item types: Calling Wand and Convening Wand. These base types are level 20 and 50 equivalents of the Convoking Wand and can roll Minion-related modifiers. Some of the new Minion-related modifiers have been added to the available pool for these Wands, and some existing modifiers have been adjusted and/or made more common.
    Helmets can no longer roll +1–3 to Level of socketed Minion Gems. Instead, they can now roll +1–2 to Level of all Minion Skill Gems. The Vendor Recipe for a Helmet with a +1 to Level of socketed Minion Gems modifier has been replaced with a new recipe. Happy hunting!
    It is now possible to obtain +2 to Level of socketed Minion Gems as a Corrupted Implicit modifier on Helmets, Body Armours, Gloves and Boots.
    Minions deal additional Damage modifiers on Ghastly Eye Jewels have been buffed by ~50% for all tiers of modifiers.
    The Prefix modifiers on Ghastly Eye Jewels that grant Minion Life Regeneration have been buffed by 100% for all tiers of modifiers.
    The Minions have 6-8% increased Attack and Cast Speed if you or your Minions have Killed Recently modifier on Ghastly Eye Jewels can no longer roll.
    Added 3 new Suffix modifiers that can roll on Ghastly Eye Jewels that grant Minions chance to Poison/Bleed/Ignite.
    The Minions have a percentage increased maximum Life Crafting Bench modifier can now be crafted on Rings and Shields, instead of Helmets, though only the Rank 1 version can be crafted on Rings.
    The Indomitable Army Notable Passive Skill no longer has "Minions have 15% increased maximum Life".
    The small Passive Skills in the Grave Intentions cluster now provide "Minions have 8% increased maximum Life" instead of "Minions have +10% to all Elemental Resistances".


    Problem: Some minion skills are clear outliers in terms of inherent power, so become the default choice for many minion-focused builds.
    Solution: Reduce the power of a couple of overperforming minion skills, and increase the power of others, with the goal of providing more minion options that feel good to play. These changes are in addition to the global minion changes detailed above.

Details:

Spoiler

    Absolution: Sentinels of Absolution now deal approximately 25% less damage at gem level 1, scaling to approximately 5% less damage at gem level 20. The player version of the skill now has +0 to radius at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to +6 at gem level 20 (previously +4). Both the player and minion versions of the skill now have 6% base Critical Strike Chance (previously 5%). The regular Minion skill now has 180% Effectiveness of Added Damage (previously 100%), and the empowered version now has 130% (previously 100%).
    Animate Guardian: Minion's attacks now deal 32–47 additional Physical Damage at gem level 1 (previously 22–34), up to 126–184 at gem level 20 (previously 56–84).

    Arakaali's Fang: The Viper Strike skill used by Raised Spiders now has a base Poison duration of 4 seconds (previously 8 seconds) and no longer has 25% of Physical Damage as Extra Chaos Damage. Player now gains 15% increased Poison Damage per Spider (previously 12%).
    Herald of Agony: Agony Crawler now gains 2% increased Attack Speed per Virulence you have at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 4% at gem level 20 (previously 3%).

    Summon Holy Relic: The Relic's nova Spell now has 250% Effectiveness of Added Damage at all gem levels (previously scaling from 70% at gem level 1 to 146% at gem level 20). It now grants approximately 50% more Life regenerated per second to Allies and Minions at all gem levels.

    Problem: Because minions are monsters, they inherit some stats from monsters that can significantly affect build choices and power. As these stats are not detailed anywhere in-game, they are a cause of confusion for a lot of players (as well as rendering minion ailment builds near-impossible except for minions specifically designed around them). The large damage bonuses granted to minions by frenzy and power charges also crowd out alternative options, especially for shield itemisation with Necromantic Aegis and utility-focused spectres.
    Solution: Split potentially-confusing monster stats into minion and non-minion versions so that minions can behave in the manner players would naturally expect.

Details:

Spoiler

    Minions no longer have hidden penalties to Bleeding, Ignite, and Poison damage. Summon Reaper no longer has a hidden bonus to Bleeding damage that counteracted this penalty. As a result, minions now deal approximately twice as much Poison damage, three and a half times as much Ignite damage, and seven times as much Bleeding damage.
    Minions now gain the same bonuses from Endurance, Frenzy and Power Charges as players do, rather than the significantly elevated bonuses that other Monsters gain.


    Problem: Investing in minion critical strikes has been possible in a very niche manner for some time now, but has never been a fully-supported build option. Additionally, the removal of a large amount of potential critical strike chance from power charges in the above change would render critical minion builds near-impossible without further changes.
    Solution: Add more sources of minion critical strike investment. These changes are not intended to fully compensate for the lost critical strike chance from power charges, but instead to more than make up for the lost damage via the addition of multiple sources of minion critical strike multiplier.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Spirit Offering Skill gem no longer grants Elemental or Chaos Resistance to Minions, and no longer causes Minions to gain a percentage of their Physical Damage as Extra Chaos Damage. It instead now grants Minions 110% increased Critical Strike Chance at gem level 1, up to 148% at gem level 20. It also grants Minions +30% to Critical Strike Multiplier at gem level 1, up to +39% at gem level 20.
    Quality on the Divergent Spirit Offering now grants Minions 0-20% increased Critical Strike Chance, instead of Minions gain +0-20% to all Elemental Resistances.
    The Helmet Enchantments that cause Spirit Offering to grant +8% or +12% of Physical Damage as Extra Chaos Damage have been replaced with Enchantments that cause Spirit Offering to grant +8% or +12% to Critical Strike Multiplier. This change affects existing items.
    The Fearsome Force Passive Skill Tree cluster no longer grants minion area of effect. It is now a larger cluster that grants minion critical strike chance and multiplier.
    The "Minions have 100% increased Critical Strike Chance" Minion Offence Mastery has been replaced with an option that provides "Minions have 30% increased Area of Effect".
    The new minion modifiers mentioned above include a family of minion critical strike chance modifiers available on wands and shields, and a family of minion critical strike multiplier modifiers on wands.


    Problem: The Necromancer's Unnatural Strength notable passive skill is extremely strong for almost all minion builds due to how well minion skills scale with gem level. This skill makes it hard to justify using other ascendancy classes for minion builds.
    Solution: Change Unnatural Strength to provide a less universally applicable stat, and allow more access to minion gem levels on items instead (as detailed above).

Details:

Spoiler

    The Necromancer's Unnatural Strength Notable Ascendancy Passive Skill no longer provides +2 to Level of all Minion Skill Gems. Instead, it now grants Minions Unholy Might.


    Problem: When reviewing support for critical minion builds, a small number of monster skills were found to have unintended very high base critical strike chance. This makes monsters using these skills more threatening to players than they are meant to be, and extremely strong when raised as spectres for summoners invested in minion critical strikes.
    Solution: Lower the critical strike chance of monster skills with unusually high base critical strike chance.

Details:

Spoiler

    The base critical strike chance of Blackguard Stormmage's Storm Call has been lowered from 40% to 6%.
    The base critical strike chance of Temple Adjudicator's and Baranite Preacher's Ball Lightning has been lowered from 32% to 6%.

Corpse Explosion Skills

    Problem: Skills that cause corpse explosions (especially those that scale ignite damage) are currently able to deal significantly more damage than intended, due to an oversight that caused Auric Champion and Auric Colossus corpses to have approximately 60% more life than any other corpse that can be spawned by the Desecrate skill.
    Solution: Reduce the life of Auric Champion and Auric Colossus corpses to be equal to that of other high life corpses, such as Kitava's Heralds.

    Problem: Skills that cause corpse explosions derive much of their damage scaling from increased maximum corpse life, mostly from skills on the passive skill tree. This pressures builds utilising these skills to choose the Necromancer ascendancy class as it provides a large value of this stat, and means that corpses of enemies you kill are not useful for damage compared to corpses you spawn yourself. Additionally, since the percentage of corpse life dealt as damage by these skills does not scale with skill levels, there is not sufficient incentive to level them up (especially for builds scaling ignite damage).
    Solution: Remove the increased maximum corpse life stat from the Necromancer ascendancy and reduce the values available elsewhere. Increase the percentage of corpse life dealt as damage for all corpse explosion skills to offset this substantial damage loss, and have this percentage scale with the level of the skill.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Corpse Pact Necromancer Ascendancy Passive no longer has "Corpses you Spawn have 50% increased maximum Life".
    The small Corpse Life Passive Skills in the Undertaker cluster now grant "Corpses you Spawn have 5% increased maximum Life" (previously 10%).
    Phantasmal Unearth: Quality now grants "Corpses spawned have 0–20% increased maximum Life" (previously 0–40%).
    Detonate Dead: Now has "Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 6% of the corpse's maximum Life" at gem level 1, up to 7.9% at gem level 20 (previously 6% at all gem levels).
    Vaal Detonate Dead: Now has "Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 6% of the corpse's maximum Life" at gem level 1, up to 7.9% at gem level 20 (previously 9% at all gem levels).
    Cremation: Now has "Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 4% of the corpse's maximum Life" at gem level 1, up to 5% at gem level 20 (previously 4% at all gem levels).
    Volatile Dead: Now has "Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 3% of the corpse's maximum Life" at gem level 1, up to 4% at gem level 20 (previously 3% at all gem levels).
    Bodyswap: Now has "Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 6% of the corpse's maximum Life" at gem level 1, up to 7.9% at gem level 20 (previously 6% at all gem levels). Now deals Fire Spell Damage equal to 4% of your maximum Life as base Fire Damage at all gem levels (previously 3%). Now has an added damage effectiveness of 100% (previously 85%), and now gains additional radius as the gem levels, up to +2 at gem level 20.

Fire Trap

    Problem: When Fire Trap's hit damage was buffed in 3.17.0, the damage over time of its burning ground was also unintentionally buffed.
    Solution: Reduce the damage of Fire Trap's burning ground to pre-3.17.0 levels.

Details:

Spoiler

    Fire Trap now deals 32.5 Base Fire Damage per second at gem level 1 (previously 30.9), up to 3018.8 Base Fire Damage per second at gem level 20 (previously 4170.7).

Return to top
Trap Cooldown and Duration

    Problem: Cooldown-based traps are balanced around being mostly a single target damage supplement, with potential to use them more frequently for builds heavily invested in doing so. However, trap builds currently have extremely efficient access to increased trap cooldown recovery rate and increased trap duration, making it easier than intended to rely on these traps as a main source of damage and making their damage uptime over a long-duration fight very high. This issue is most obvious with Seismic Trap in the current state of the game, but also applies to other cooldown trap skills.
    Solution: Trim the availability of trap cooldown and duration. Compensate the damage of cooldown trap skills that are underperforming as a result.

Details:

Spoiler

    Advanced Traps Support no longer has 10%–29% increased Skill Effect Duration.
    The Hasty Reconstruction Notable Passive Skill has been renamed to Overprepared and no longer grants 30% increased Cooldown Recovery Rate for throwing Traps.
    Flamethrower Trap now deals 6 to 9 Fire Damage at gem level 1 (previously 5 to 8), up to 243 to 366 Fire Damage at gem level 20 (previously 211 to 319).
    Lightning Spire Trap now deals 15 to 45 Lightning Damage at gem level 1 (previously 15 to 46), up to 238 to 713 Lightning Damage at gem level 20 (previously 207 to 622). Now has 85% effectiveness of Added Damage (previously 75%).

Return to top
Seismic Trap

    Problem: Seismic Trap's damage potential is too high even with the above changes accounted for.
    Solution: Seismic Trap now deals approximately 30% less damage at all gem levels.

Details:

Spoiler

    Seismic Trap: Now deals 46 to 68 Physical Damage at gem level 1 (previously 65 to 98), up to 597 to 896 at gem level 20 (previously 853 to 1280).

Return to top
Explosive Arrow

    Problem: Explosive Arrow currently has a single stat for hit and ailment damage per arrow stuck in the target, but this makes it impossible to reduce the damage of overperforming ignite builds without also affecting underperforming hit-based builds.
    Solution: Split the hit and ailment damage bonus for stacking arrows on a target into two stats. Reduce ailment damage and slightly increase hit damage.

Details:

Spoiler

    Explosive Arrow no longer has "Explosion deals 5% more Damage with Hits and Ailments per Explosive Arrow on Target. Instead, it now has "Explosion deals 6% more Damage with Hits per Explosive Arrow on Target" and "Explosion deals 3% more Damage with Ailments per Explosive Arrow on Target".

Return to top
Cast on Death Support

    Problem: When spell base damage values were dramatically increased in 3.17.0 and methods of triggering spells had their power reduced in compensation, Cast when Damage Taken Support and Cast on Death Support were omitted.
    Solution: Increase the damage penalty of Cast when Damage Taken Support and reduce the damage bonus of Cast on Death Support to match the changes made to other trigger mechanisms in 3.17.0.

Details:

Spoiler

    Cast when Damage Taken Support now causes Supported Skills to deal 65% less Damage at gem level 1 (previously 70%), up to 27% less Damage at gem level 20 (previously 6% more Damage).
    Cast on Death Support now has 0% more Damage while Dead at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 152% at gem level 20 (previously 304%).

    Problem: The Anomalous alternate quality of Cast on Death Support makes it too easy to guarantee a critical strike for boss-killing builds using Cast on Death.
    Solution: Quality on the Anomalous Cast on Death Support now grants "Supported Skills have +0–10% to Critical Strike Chance while Dead" (previously 0–100%).

Return to top
Blessing Skills

    Problem: Divine Blessing Support is intended to allow characters who do not wish to reserve much of their mana to still use an aura by casting the aura for a normal mana cost every few seconds. The cost of the supported aura is calculated based on that aura's original reservation requirement, and therefore usually requires spending a large portion of your maximum mana. However, due to technical limitations, the cost is still calculated based on the size of your mana pool if it paid using life. This allows players who are reserving most of their mana to support an aura with both Divine Blessing Support and Lifetap Support, and occasionally spend a few thousand life to gain an extra aura beyond the amount they would otherwise be able to run.
    Solution: Prevent Lifetap Support from supporting Blessing skills, to match its counterpart Arrogance Support. Provide slight compensation for this change on Divine Blessing Support, and update Eternal Blessing Support to match.

Details:

Spoiler

    Blessing Skills can no longer be supported by Lifetap.
    Skills supported by Divine Blessing Support now have 10% increased Aura Effect at gem level 1 (previously 0%), up to 29% at gem level 20 (previously 19%).
    Eternal Blessing Support now grants Supported Skills 0% increased Aura Effect at gem level 1 (previously 19% reduced), up to 19% increased at gem level 20 (previously 0% increased).

Return to top
Sniper's Mark

    Problem: Sniper's Mark provides a large amount of power to projectile builds, but also provides powerful flask charge generation. Generating life flask charges in particular provides a lot of mostly hidden power for builds utilising Sniper's Mark, even though it is rarely a consideration when deciding whether or not to use the skill in a build. The combination of projectile stats and flask charge generation put the skill into a state that is too powerful compared to other mark skills.
    Solution: Remove the life and mana flask charge generation from Sniper's Mark.

Return to top
Hydrosphere

    Problem: Hydrosphere was previously commonly used to provide an extra target to hit, allowing many skills to benefit from extra damage splashing, projectile chain and so on against single targets. A cooldown was added to being able to hit Hydrosphere in patch 3.17.0, but this cooldown is necessarily per entity, meaning that Hydrosphere still provides an enormous damage bonus in cases where many different entities are hitting it (most notably minion builds).
    Solution: Only allow Hydrosphere to be hit by the entity that cast it.

Return to top
Underperforming Skills

    Problem: Due to Path of Exile's constant evolution, there are sometimes skill and support gems that are left feeling underwhelming to use.
    Solution: Carry out a routine balance pass on a selection of underperforming skill and support gems, with the aim of making them more attractive options.

Details:

Spoiler

    Artillery Ballista now has 50% Effectiveness of Added Damage at gem level 1 (previously 44%), up to 65% at gem level 20 (previously 57%). It now has a base explosion radius of 20 (previously 18). Arrows now take 250 ms to fall (previously 330 ms) and the delay between arrows is now 100 ms (previously 150 ms).
    Blazing Salvo now deals 7–10 Fire Damage at gem level 1 (previously 6–9), up to 270–405 at gem level 20 (previously 241–361). Now has 60% Effectiveness of Added Damage (previously 55%).
    Cleave now has +0 to Radius at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to +10 to Radius at gem level 20 (previously +8).
    Crackling Lance now has a base Beam Width of 12 (previously 10) and gains +3 to Beam Width per Intensity (previously +2).
    Decoy Totem now has 0% increased Totem Life at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 76% at gem level 20 (previously 38%).
    Devouring Totem now has 20% more base life, and has 0% increased Totem Life at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 76% at gem level 20 (previously 0%).
    Energy Blade now has "Two Handed Energy Blades have 70% more Lightning Damage" (previously 50%).
    Firestorm now has one impact every 0.15 seconds (previously every 0.2 seconds).
    Haste now grants 10% increased Movement Speed and 15% increased Attack and Cast Speed at gem level 1 (previously 4% and 9%), up to 15% and 24% at gem level 20 (previously 9% and 16%). Vaal Haste now grants 16% increased Movement Speed at gem level 1 (previously 10%), up to 20% at gem level 20 (previously 13%). The Attack and Cast Speed granted by Vaal Haste has not been changed.
    Reave now has 170% Effectiveness of Added Damage at gem level 1 (previously 150%), up to 250% at gem level 20 (previously 225%). Vaal Reave now has 250% Effectiveness of Added Damage at gem level 1 (previously 200%), up to 350% at gem level 20 (previously 313%).
    Rejuvenation Totem now has 20% more base life, and has 0% increased Totem Life at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 76% at gem level 20 (previously 0%). Its Aura now Regenerates 8.6 Life per second at gem level 1 (previously 6.3), up to 317.5 at gem level 20 (previously 162.2). Quality on Divergent Rejuvenation Totem now grants 0–20% increased Aura Effect (previously 0–60%).
    Scorching Ray now deals 13.4 Base Fire Damage per second at gem level 1 (previously 12.8), up to 780.7 at gem level 20 (previously 696.3).
    Scourge Arrow now has 30% Damage Effectiveness at gem level 1 (previously 28%), up to 40% at gem level 20 (previously 35%).
    Shock Nova no longer has 20% chance to Shock Enemies, or increased Effect of Shock. Instead, it now has +10% to maximum Effect of Shock, and Ring always Shocks. Quality on Anomalous Shock Nova no longer provides "Ring has 0–40% chance to Shock".
    Soulrend now deals 21–31 Chaos damage at gem level 1 (previously 19–28), up to 885–1327 at gem level 20 (previously 716–1074). Now has 170% Effectiveness of Added Damage (previously 150%). It now deals 180.9 Base Chaos Damage per second at gem level 1 (previously 164.9), up to 2642.5 at gem level 20 (previously 2138.5).
    Spellslinger now grants Added Spell Damage equal to 60% of Damage of Equipped Wand at gem level 1 (previously 50%), up to 174% at gem level 20 (previously 100%).
    Sunder now has 220% Effectiveness of Added Damage at gem level 1 (previously 175%), up to 325% at gem level 20 (previously 275%). Its damaging wave now travels 60% faster.
    Vaal Flameblast now has 200% more Spell Damage for each stage (previously 140%).
    Arrow Nova Support now causes Supported Skills to deal 30% less Projectile Damage at gem level 1 (previously 40%), up to 16% less at gem level 20 (previously 26%).
    Awakened Arrow Nova Support now causes Supported Skills to deal 15% less Projectile Damage at gem level 1 (previously 25%), up to 11% less at gem level 5 (previously 21%).
    Urgent Orders Support now causes Supported Skills to have 50% increased Warcry Speed at gem level 1 (previously 30%), up to 69% at gem level 20 (previously 49%).
    Critical Strike Affliction Support now causes Supported Skills to have +70% Damage over Time Multiplier for Ailments from Critical Strikes at gem level 1 (previously +55%), up to +98% at gem level 20 (previously +83%).

Return to top
Vaal Clarity

    Problem: Vaal Clarity's relatively low soul cost allows you to consistently bypass the mana costs of skills with high costs but long durations with proper timing while clearing areas. It is currently too easy to achieve this.
    Solution: Increase the soul cost of Vaal Clarity and slightly increase its duration.

Details:

Spoiler

    Vaal Clarity now has a cost 50 Souls per use (previously 30), and has a duration of 10 seconds at all gem levels (previously 8 seconds at gem Level 1, up to 9.90 at gem Level 20).

Return to top
Awakened Hextouch

    Problem: The stat granted by Awakened Hextouch Support that grants a chance for Hexes to bypass Hexproof was not working as expected. Attempting to reapply a Curse to a Hexproof monster using this stat but failing would still remove the existing Curse on that monster, as if it was overwritten by the new Curse
    Solution: Failing to apply a Curse to a Hexproof enemy will no longer remove Curses on that enemy.

Return to top
Blood Sacrament

    Problem: The Blood Sacrament skill is exclusively granted by the Relic of the Pact unique wand. This wand was only available in Ultimatum League (and subsequently in Standard League through trading). Because it has been a legacy item for the past few leagues, the Blood Sacrament skill hasn't received balance adjustments when changes impacting it have been made. Additionally, Blood Sacrament's very short cast time is necessary for the skill to function but also encourages trying to spam it as fast as possible while reserving as much life as possible, which is not a healthy playstyle for the game to support to this extent.
    Solution: Adjust Blood Sacrament to account for the rework to reservation mechanics, changes to support gem cost multipliers, and various self-cast spell buffs that have occurred since it was last available. Add a very short cooldown to Blood Sacrament to prevent spamming it as fast as possible being the optimal usage strategy.

Details:

Spoiler

    Blood Sacrament, granted by the Relic of the Pact Unique Wand, now deals ~58% more Base Damage. It no longer has 80% more Damage with Hits and Ailments per 10 Life Reserved by this Skill. Instead, it now has 40% more Damage with Ailments per 10 Life Reserved by this Skill, and 80% more Damage with Hits per 10 Life Reserved by this Skill. It now gains +0.3% to Radius per 1% Life Reserved by this Skill (previously +0.4), and has a base Life Reservation of 2% (previously 3%). Now has a 0.35 second cooldown, and a 0.2 second cast time (previously 0.24 second).

Ascendancy Balance

Return to top
Trickster

    Problem: The Trickster ascendancy class has caused multiple balance issues over the years, but changes to the class have increasingly left it lacking a compelling identity or sufficient power.
    Solution: Rework the Trickster ascendancy, focusing more tightly on thematically-appropriate defences and speed.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Trickster Ascendancy has been reworked. Following is each notable passive, what it now grants, and its prerequisite (if it has one).
    Heartstopper: Every 10 seconds, Take 40% less Damage from Hits for 5 seconds and Take 40% less damage over Time for 5 seconds. These are consecutive, rather than simultaneous. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 4% increased Movement Speed.
    Polymath: 3% more Damage for each different type of Mastery you have Allocated, and Recover 1% of Life, Energy Shield, and Mana on Kill for each different type of Mastery you have Allocated. The small Passive Skill prior grants 10% increased Damage, 14% increased Evasion Rating, and 5% increased maximum Energy Shield.
    Swift Killer: 200% increased Charge Duration, and +2 to maximum Frenzy Charges. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 15% increased Frenzy Charge Duration.
    One Step Ahead: Your Action Speed is at least 108% of base value, and Nearby Enemy Monster's Action Speed is at most 92% of base value. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 4% increased Attack and Cast Speed.
    Escape Artist: +5 to Evasion Rating per 1 maximum Energy Shield on Helmet, and +1 to maximum Energy Shield per 6 Evasion Rating on Body Armour. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 4% increased Movement Speed.
    Soul Drinker: Requires Escape Artist. 2% of Damage Leeched as Energy Shield, 20% increased Attack and Cast Speed while Leeching Energy Shield, and Energy Shield Leech effects are not removed when Energy Shield is Filled. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 40% increased total Recovery per second from Energy Shield Leech.
    Spellbreaker: Requires Escape Artist. +20% chance to Suppress Spell Damage, prevent +10% of Suppressed Spell Damage while on Full Energy Shield, and 50% chance for Energy Shield Recharge to start when you Suppress Spell Damage. The small Passive Skill prior grants 14% increased Evasion Rating, 5% increased maximum Energy Shield, and 10% increased Energy Shield Recharge Rate.


    The Ascendant's Trickster Ascendancy Passive Skill has been changed as a result of the Trickster Ascendancy rework. It now grants prevent +6% of Suppressed Spell Damage while on Full Energy Shield, 2% more Damage for each different type of Mastery you have Allocated, 2% of Damage Leeched as Energy Shield, and Nearby Enemy Monster's Action Speed is at most 92% of base value.

Existing Forbidden Flame and Forbidden Flesh Unique Jewels that provided Trickster Notables that have been removed have been updated as follows:

    Jewels that allocated Weave the Arcane now allocate One Step Ahead.
    Jewels that allocated Patient Reaper now allocate Polymath.
    Jewels that allocated Prolonged Pain now allocate Spellbreaker.

    The variation of Forbidden Flame and Forbidden Flesh that allocated Soul Drinker now allocates Harness the Void.

Return to top
Juggernaut

    Problem: Juggernaut's Unbreakable skill is overly complicated and therefore requires each stat granted to be watered down, meaning that Juggernaut players aren't able to focus on the stats they want from the skill.
    Solution: Split Unbreakable into two narrower but more powerful skills.

Details:

Spoiler

    Juggernaut's Unbreakable Notable Ascendancy Passive Skill no longer grants Regenerate 2% of Life per second, 5% reduced Damage taken, or 1.5% of Physical Damage prevented from Hits in the past 10 seconds is Regenerated as Life per second. It now grants 8% of Armour applies to Elemental Damage from Hits.
    Added a new Notable Ascendancy Passive Skill to Juggernaut: Untiring. It grants 40% increased Life Regeneration rate and 1.5% of Physical Damage prevented from Hits in the past 10 seconds is Regenerated as Life per second.

Return to top
Chieftain

    Problem: Chieftain's Tawhoa, Forest's Strength skill doesn't provide enough damage to be attractive to slam-based builds, especially when it has to compensate for not being exertable and not synergising with Fist of War Support.
    Solution: Slams used by Tawhoa's Chosen now deal 100% more damage (previously 50%).

Return to top
Pathfinder

    Problem: Pathfinder's Master Alchemist skill is quite weak, which also causes Pathfinder to be pushed mostly towards chaos-based builds as non-chaos builds do not have enough compelling ascendancy skills to choose from.
    Solution: Add more power to Master Alchemist. Partially compensate by removing extraneous power from the much stronger Nature's Boon.

Details:

Spoiler

    Pathfinder's Master Alchemist Notable Ascendancy Passive Skill no longer grants 20% chance to Freeze, Shock and Ignite during any Flask Effect. Instead, it now causes Magic Utility Flasks applied to you to have 20% increased Effect.
    Pathfinder's Nature's Boon Notable Ascendancy Passive Skill no longer grants 6% reduced Elemental Damage taken.

Crystallised Omniscience

    Problem: Crystallised Omniscience and Ashes of the Stars are powerful unique amulets that have both been adopted by a wide variety of builds since their introduction in Siege of the Atlas. However, while Ashes of the Stars is a relatively standalone item that enhances the individual strengths of a build, Crystallised Omniscience encourages players to devote a substantial portion of their build towards stacking attributes. It also makes it easy to do so by providing the elemental resistances which would otherwise compete for space with attributes on your items. This reduces the diversity of itemisation across a wide variety of elemental builds.
    Solution: Lower the amount of elemental penetration and resistances granted by Crystallised Omniscience, with the aim of it still being powerful but not the ideal choice for such a large variety of builds.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Crystallised Omniscience Unique Amulet now grants +1% to All Elemental Resistances per 15 Omniscience (previously 10 Omniscience) and "Penetrate 1% Elemental Resistances per 15 Omniscience" (previously 10 Omniscience). This change affects existing items.

Return to top
Melding of the Flesh

    Problem: Melding of the Flesh is a unique jewel that transfers your highest maximum elemental resistance to your other elemental resistances. Though it comes with a substantial penalty to your base resistances, it is an extremely powerful item that has outcompeted other forms of elemental damage mitigation for well-itemised builds.
    Solution: Add a penalty to maximum elemental resistances to Melding of the Flesh, forcing builds that want to reach 90% in all elemental resistances to commit more of their build to reaching it.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Melding of the Flesh Unique Jewel now has -4% to -6% to all Maximum Elemental Resistances. This change does not affect existing versions of this Unique.

Return to top
Effect of Shock

    Problem: Having all sources of maximum shock effect override your maximum rather than add to it prevents investment in multiple sources of maximum shock effect, which becomes less reasonable as more sources are added. However, changing this in isolation may cause attack-focussed unique weapons with shock-related stats to become best-in-slot for the newly added shock spells, which would be an undesirable outcome.
    Solution: Make sources of maximum shock effect additive with each other. Tweak shock application stats on Voltaxic Rift and Brain Rattler to only apply to shocks with weapon damage.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Voltaxic Rift Unique Bow now has Hits with this Weapon Shock Enemies as though dealing 300% more Damage, instead of Shock Enemies as though dealing 300% more Damage. It also now has +40% to maximum Effect of Shock, instead of Your Shocks can increase Damage taken by up to a maximum of 100%. This change affects existing versions of the unique, unless something has gone terribly wrong.
    The Brain Rattler Unique Mace now has Hits with this Weapon Shock Enemies as though dealing 300% more Damage, instead of Shock Enemies as though dealing 300% more Damage. Existing versions of this unique are affected by this change.
    The Lightning Passive Skill Mastery that grants "Your Shocks can increase Damage taken by up to a maximum of 60%" has been replaced with +15% to Maximum Effect of Shock.

Brittle Ailment

    Problem: The base critical strike chance provided by the Brittle ailment serves as an enormous effective damage boost to builds focused on it. As more and more methods of investing in alternate ailments are added to the game, Brittle has begun to overshadow other ailments.
    Solution: Reduce the amount of critical strike chance provided by Brittle to make it more comparable to Scorch and Shock.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Brittle Ailment now grants up to +6% chance to critically strike afflicted enemies (previously +15%) and now has a default value of +2% (previously +5%).

Return to top
Reservation Efficiency

    Problem: The introduction of reservation efficiency has encouraged a much larger range of builds to invest in reservation skills to a small or moderate degree. This is not a problem in itself, but currently the options for doing so are similar for every build, and provide slightly too much generic power relative to the investment required. Reservation mastery options are the biggest outliers in power, as they provide larger amounts of power than entire notable passive skills.
    Solution: Remove the mana reservation efficiency mastery and reduce the power of the aura effect and life reservation efficiency masteries.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Reservation Mastery that granted 15% increased Mana Reservation Efficiency of Skills has been removed from the Passive Skill Tree.
    The Reservation Mastery that grants increased Life Reservation Efficiency of Skills now has a value of 20% (previously 30%).
    The Reservation Mastery that causes Auras from your Skills to have an increased Effect on you now has a value of 10% (previously 15%).

Return to top
Flask charges when Hit modifiers

    Problem: The line of flask modifiers that grant flask charges when you are hit by an enemy make it too easy to keep your flasks active permanently for most non-boss content.
    Solution: Lower the values of flask modifiers that grant charges when you are hit by an enemy.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Delinquent's and Sinner's modifiers can no longer be rolled on Flasks. The Transgressor's, Masochist's and Flagellant's modifiers now provide 1, 2 and 3 charges when hit by an enemy respectively (previously 4, 6 and 7 charges). Existing items can be updated to these new values using a Divine Orb.

Return to top
Non-Aura Skills Cost no Mana or Life while Focused Veiled modifier

    Problem: The Veiled and Crafted Modifiers that cause Skills to cost no Mana or Life while Focused undermine the importance of skill costs and constrain design space. As mentioned in the 3.17.0 Patch Notes, we originally planned to disable them in 3.18.0, but this was pushed back due to the freeze on character balance in 3.18.0.
    Solution: Non-Aura Skills Cost no Mana or Life while Focused can no longer appear as a veiled modifier on Amulets, and the crafted version is no longer available.

Return to top
Chainbreaker

    Problem: The timeless jewel-exclusive Chainbreaker keystone is too difficult to properly use, while also limiting the potential to provide other sources of rage regeneration.
    Solution: Rework Chainbreaker to lean into rage as a resource in a more extreme manner, and remove potentially unwanted interactions with other sources of rage regeneration.

Details:

Spoiler

Damage taken recouped as Life

    Problem: Damage taken recouped as life is a relatively new recovery option, and there are not currently enough sources of it available for players who wish to invest heavily in it.
    Solution: Incrementally improve the availability of this stat by adding it to the jewel modifier pool.

Details:

Spoiler

    Crimson, Viridian and Cobalt Jewels can now roll 4–6% of damage taken recouped as Life as a suffix modifier.

Passive Skill Tree Sources of Lightning Damage

    Problem: Lightning Damage has fewer passive tree clusters than other elemental damage types.
    Solution: Split out a generic Lightning Mastery stat into a new passive skill tree cluster focused on Lightning Damage and Critical Strikes. Replace the Lightning Mastery option.

Details:

Spoiler

    "80% increased Critical Strike Chance against Shocked Enemies" is no longer a Lightning Mastery option. It has been replaced with "Shocks you inflict spread to other Enemies within a Radius of 10".
    The Arcing Blows cluster has been moved to the Shadow area of the tree, above Fatal Toxins.
    A new cluster has been added where Arcing Blows used to be. It grants Critical Strike Multiplier with Lightning Skills and Critical Strike Chance against Shocked enemies.

Ailment Duration while Focused mod

    Problem: The Veiled modifier that grants Ailment Duration while Focused provides an overwhelming amount of single target damage to poison-based builds for the cost of a single modifier slot, even in long-duration fights where its inconsistent uptime is taken into account.
    Solution: Roughly halve the values of this modifier.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Veiled modifier that grants increased Duration of Ailments you inflict while Focused now has values of 81-90% (previously 161-180%).
    Crafted versions of this modifier have been adjusted, now provide values of 41-50% at the lowest tier, and 81-90% at the highest tier.

Return to top
Avoid being Stunned Flask modifier

    Problem: The crafted version of the Veiled modifier on flasks that grants chance to avoid being stunned has higher values than the highest tier of the similar non-crafted modifier family. Bench-crafted modifiers should never be the highest available value of a given modifier.
    Solution: Buff the values of randomly rolled stun avoidance chance on flasks such that the values of the highest tier are higher than the bench-crafted version.

Details:

Spoiler

    The suffix modifier on Flasks that provides a chance to Avoid being Stunned during Flask Effect now has values of at 31-35% the lowest tier (previously 16-21%), up to 51-55% at the highest tier (previously 40-45%).

Return to top
Wrecking Ball

    Problem: The two small passive skills prior to the Wrecking Ball Notable provide differing amounts of hit and ailment damage.
    Solution: The two small Passive Skills prior to the Wrecking Ball Notable now provide "Attacks with Two Handed Melee Weapons deal 12% increased Damage with Ailments" (previously 10%), to match the increased Physical Damage with Two Handed Weapons also provided.

Return to top
Reduced Trap Duration

    Problem: Sources of reduced Trap duration are currently only useful when combined with the Sunblast unique belt. However, changes to Sunblast make some of them too powerful for this use case.
    Solution: Change sources of reduced Trap duration to instead grant other stats, avoiding the Sunblast abuse case but making them slightly more powerful for other builds.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Set and Forget Cluster Jewel Notable Passive Skill no longer has 25% reduced Trap Duration, 12% increased Area of Effect. Instead, it now has Skills used by Traps have 15% increased Area of Effect.
    Quality on the Anomalous Swift Assembly Support Gem now grants Supported Skills have 0-20% increased Trap Duration (previously 0-40% reduced).

Return to top
Molten Shell Buff Effect Enchant

    Problem: Labyrinth-enchanted helmets can grant increased Molten Shell buff effect. A player could reasonably assume that buff effect in this context applies to the amount of armour granted, the percentage of damage absorbed by the buff, and the maximum amount of damage absorbed by the buff. In reality, however, it only affects the amount of armour granted. This makes the Molten Shell buff effect helmet enchants quite misleading, as well as underpowered.
    Solution: Disable these helmet enchantments.

Details:

Spoiler

    The Labyrinth Helmet Enchantments that grant increased Molten Shell Buff Effect can no longer be obtained, though existing versions are unaffected.

Return to top
Vaal Breach

    Problem: Due to a technical limitation, Vaal Breach is not able to be obtained through corrupting Portal Gems.
    Solution: Vaal Breach now has a chance to drop from killing Breachlords in areas opened from Flawless Breachstones.

Return to top
Recombinators

    Problem: The use of Recombinators on Mirrored items can allow players to modify Mirrored items with a fairly high degree of control, causing some unintentionally powerful results when clever crafting methods are used. It would also allow transfer of the extremely powerful modifiers available on Mirrored items in the Kalandra League, which are intended to be balanced by only appearing on items that can't be modified.
    Solution: Existing Recombinators in permanent leagues can no longer be used on Mirrored items.

Return to top
Adrenaline Buff

    Problem: The Adrenaline buff is intended to not be possible to gain while you already have Adrenaline. However, some sources of the buff do not have this restriction.
    Solution: Adrenaline now inherently cannot be gained while you already have Adrenaline.

Return to top
Monster Changes

    Monsters are now unable to evade reflected damage.
    Chilled ground from the Permafrost Archnemesis modifier now counts as Vortex ground, and can no longer stack with other sources of Vortex ground.
    Unstable Wetas now leave Vortex ground effect on death, instead of Cold Snap ground, and cannot stack with other sources of Vortex ground effect.
    The Beachhead Boss Fight no longer drops normal rarity weapons throughout the fight, as Animate Weapon no longer requires them.
    Fixed a bug where buffs that alternate to provide different stats, such as more and reduced damage taken buffs on monsters with the Loathing Essence modifier, were not working. As a result, the following changes have been made for Essence Monsters: Reduced the amount of Attack, Cast and Movement Speed granted by Zeal Essence modifiers on Monsters; reduced the amount of reduced Damage Taken granted by Loathing Essence modifiers on Monsters; Scorn Essence modifiers now grant 75% reduced extra Damage Taken from Critical Strikes to the affected Monster, instead of Cannot be Critically Struck.

Divination Card Changes

    Crimson, Viridian, Cobalt and Abyss Jewels are now potential reward outcomes when turning in a stack of Magnum Opus Divination Cards.

    Some of the Map Bosses you are required to defeat to upgrade your Pantheon have changed as a result of these Atlas changes.
    Crafting Recipes that were previously unlocked in Maps that have been removed are now found within other Maps currently on the Atlas.

    Highlighting a mastery on the passive skill tree now highlights all masteries of the same type.
    Added the ability to select which microtransaction tier to display as the maximum tier for relevant equipped microtransactions. For example, you can choose to have a semi-jacked Maroider as the highest displayed tier, rather than absolutely jacked Maroider.
    The 'SetTextColor' Alpha value in Item Filters now also affects the transparency of Sockets on dropped items.
